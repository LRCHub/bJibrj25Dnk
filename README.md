```
How’s it going? What’s up?
Doing ok. lately?
What’s the matter with your
face?
You don’t look good with blue.
I’m already sick and tired of
singing about the negatives.
I’m giving away the different
things now.
I went through lots of things,
since you have been gone.
Oh well just sing with me for
now.
Melodies with memories
hold me together
Memories of melodies
Make me stronger
Coz I will breathe, I will sing.
I’ll live tomorrow.
And you’ll do you, how you do,
it’s up to you I’ll promise,
I’ll be back.
