In dark years of pain
We borne the life
The perfected dying
We can't more survive

At first was the fire, the beginning of the end
Then was the man, the dying began
He took a torch into the hand
Blind with rage, sick with hate

The remains of the past decay to dust
Winds blow away the message from the past

In dark years of pain
We borne the life
The perfected dying
We can't more survive

Storms of torches weakened the land
The ruins of fire still are present
A peaceful man, a deceitful shine
The fire is present, the torch still in the hand

The remains of the past decay to dust
Winds blow away the message from the past

We will forget the dead of wars
We are naive enough that to ignore
A peaceful time, a blooming land
I prophesy the coming end
