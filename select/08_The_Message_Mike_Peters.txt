It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs
You know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, I couldn't get far
'Cause the man with the tow truck repossessed my car

Standing on the front stoop hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady living in a bag
Eating outta garbage pails used to be a fag hag
Says she danced the tango, the light fandango
Was zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show, watching all the creeps so
She could tell the story to the girls back home
She went to the city and she got social security
She had to get a pension, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me
I'm close to the edge
I try not to lose my head
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under

My brothers doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
"All My Children" in the daytime, "Dallas" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't train to the job, there's a strike at the station
A neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cankered membrane
I'm going insane, I might hijack a plane
Don't push me
I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Say what

My son said "Daddy, I don't want to go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
The kids smoke reefer
I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job learned to be a street sweeper"
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
Don't push me
'Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Say what
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you go through
You'll admire all the number book-takers
Thugs, pimps, pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
You wanna grow up to be just like them
Smugglers, scrambler, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers, even panhandlers
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
