[00:00.95] My song is love
[00:08.45] 
[00:08.74] Love to the loveless shown
[00:21.74] 
[00:16.95] And it goes on
[00:23.95] 
[00:24.17] You don't have to be alone
[00:37.17] 
[00:33.37] Your heavy heart
[00:41.37] 
[00:41.64] Is made of stone
[00:49.64] 
[00:49.97] And it's so hard to see clearly
[00:56.97] You don't have to be on your own
[01:04.98] You don't have to be on your own
[01:20.98] 
[01:15.13] And I'm not gonna take it back
[01:23.23] And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
[01:31.48] You're the target that I'm aiming at
[01:37.96] And I'll get that message home
[01:52.96] 
[01:47.52] My song is love
[01:55.02] 
[01:55.47] My song is love unknown
[02:06.97] 
[02:03.92] And I'm on fire for you, clearly
[02:10.86] You don't have to be alone
[02:18.81] You don't have to be on your own
[02:34.81] 
[02:29.07] And I'm not gonna take it back
[02:44.07] 
[02:37.23] And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
[02:45.56] You're the target that I'm aiming at
[02:52.06] And I'm nothing on my own
[03:00.11] Got to get that message home
[03:14.11] 
[03:26.99] And I'm not gonna stand and wait
[03:34.73] Not gonna leave it until it's much too late, oh
[03:42.52] On a platform, I'm gonna stand and say
[03:49.57] That I'm nothing on my own
[03:57.52] And I love you, please come home
[04:13.52] 
[04:22.53] My song is love, is love unknown
[04:30.44] And I've got to get that message home
